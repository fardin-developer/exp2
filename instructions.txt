there is two API
  1. First API will send video id of every video of that playlist_link. Eg:-
    
//playlist of two videos

    {
      "contentDetails": {
        "videoId": "RqiU5nzj_nU"
      }
    },
    {
      "contentDetails": {
        "videoId": "T_U_VsHkc_Y"
      }
    }


  2. We have to pass each video id in 2nd url and make a request. It will response
   duration of that video
